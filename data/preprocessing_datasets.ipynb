            "Well, the workload has increased significantly, and I find it hard to maintain a work-life balance. I've been staying late at the office, and it feels like I'm constantly under a pile of never-ending tasks. It's just so hard to keep up, and it's impacting my overall well-being.\n",
            "I've been trying to prioritize my tasks and delegate whenever possible. I've also started practicing meditation during my breaks to help manage stress. But sometimes, it feels like no matter what I do, I can't catch a break. It's been a constant struggle.\n",
            "You're right. I haven't really opened up about my struggles to my coworkers or supervisor. I guess I've been afraid of appearing weak or incapable. How can I approach this discussion without feeling vulnerable?\n",
            "Thank you for your understanding and guidance. I appreciate the reminder that I don't have to face this alone. I'll gather my courage and initiate that conversation soon. I need to prioritize my well-being and find a healthier balance.\n"
